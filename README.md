# Interactive-Health-Bot
This Repository consists of code for Interactive health bot which is a voice assisted disease classifier. Uisng Raspberry-Pi, informations of the user such as temperature, symptoms are taken. Temperature sensor is integrated with the RPi and symptoms are taken in terms of speech. Speech to text conversion is carried out using Google API. Natural Language Processing is carried out on the input to extract symptoms from the input. The symptoms are then classified, if a reasonable classification could not be made, the user is presented with a set of questions that will help the classifier. Random forest classifier is used to classify the symptoms to their respective diseases as accurately as possible.
